Our farming-as-a-service model combines proprietary technology, indoor growing expertise, and production facilities, to deliver bespoke value to our customers in the short-term while our R&D efforts contribute to climate change solutions for the long term.
About The Role
We’re looking for a Full Stack Software Engineer to be an integral member of a small, cross-functional team, that builds and maintains software systems designed to interact with our mechanical and electrical hardware components to support our farming and business initiatives. You will help us develop and adapt our proprietary farm management platform to support the needs of our farming-as-a-service and R&D customers.
We have a wide range of technical solutions to innovate - including farm control, improving user experience, data reporting and visualization, and lots of workflow automation connecting the electrical and mechanical hardware components of our farms to our software.
These technology solutions will support farming-as-a-service and R&D farming activities within our proprietary hydroponic farm systems, exploring innovative ways to facilitate data collection, having cloud-connected farms alert farmers when they're running low on water, and surfacing valuable insights from the data we collect. This means being comfortable integrating existing sensors, apps, APIs, and services as well as developing new innovative solutions on the fly. AI and machine learning are becoming more important to Square Roots as well, as our network of farms and farmers create millions of data points using electrical and environmental sensors that can continuously teach us how to grow better food.
This role is hybrid, and candidates must have the ability to commute to our office in the Brooklyn Navy Yard on a frequent basis.
What You'll Do
- Create and iterate on full-stack web and IoT applications using a variety of technologies including but not limited to Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, GraphQL, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Raspberry Pi, Python and AWS IoT Greengrass.
- Develop internal tools and workflow automation to support Farming Operations, R&D, Hardware, and Business Development teams.
- Identify and solve the most important technical and business problems as part of a very collaborative interdisciplinary team.
Qualifications
- Demonstrated Full-Stack experience
- Object-oriented programming languages such as Ruby or Python.
- React or a similar front-end web framework.
- System design, data structures, and algorithms.
- Data modeling and relational/non-relational databases.
- Continuous integration and automatic deployments (Big Plus).
- Familiarity with microcomputers/controllers such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Experience with writing low-level programming for sensing or hardware control (Big Plus).
- Familiarity with rapid software prototyping tools such as Figma, Streamlit, Google Colab, etc.. (Big Plus).
- Experience building IoT systems using frameworks such as AWS IoT Greengrass (Big Plus).
- You’ve grown food with hydroponics or other controlled-environment agriculture techniques, or from soil (Big Plus).
You'll Love Working At Square Roots Because
- We're here to change the food system. You'll have the opportunity to play a significant role in our work at the intersection of technology, farming, and the global food industry - and we're only just getting started. 
- Our team is driven by a shared set of values. These keep us aligned and remind us how to show up every day in the face of growth and ambiguity. Whether you’re working remotely or on the farms, collaboration, respect, optimism and humility are all embraced, and we seek to empower people at every step. Ask us about the rest!
- Benefits and perks, of course. We're all here first and foremost to play our part in the mission, but medical, dental, and vision coverage, flexible work life culture, and lots of samples of the delicious food we grow certainly do not hurt.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Software Engineer (Backend),Column,"San Francisco, CA",2025-02-05,"$20,000 (unspecified rate)","About Column
For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.
At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!
The Opportunity
We’re a lean and experienced team. We like our current team size of nine engineers but we have a need for a talented Backend engineer to join us. We write mostly Go, but experience there isn’t that important (it’s a pretty easy language to learn). We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high-caliber and high-velocity team. We’ll require a take-home that does take time, so if that’s a non-starter for you we’re sorry. We find it the best way for you to show your skills, without being overly burdensome on the team! This role is San Francisco based and you’ll be expected to work out of our (awesome) Presidio-based office 3+ days a week.
What You’ll Need To Be Successful
- Proven experience with a strongly typed back-end language, coupled with proficiency in SQL
- A track record of making independent product decisions and exhibiting strong self-management skills.
- Preferably, an interest and desire in the financial services/fintech industry is ideal, but not a requirement, as long as you have a desire to deeply learn our products and industry.
What You’ll Get From Us
- 🏥 Comprehensive health, dental, and vision plans, including options that are 100% covered by Column for you and 100% covered for your dependents!
- 👶 Comprehensive family planning and fertility benefits via partnership with Carrot, including reimbursement of up to $20,000 in qualified expenses
- 💳 FSA and HSA account options to enable use of pre-tax money for medical and dependent care expenses
- 📈 401k plan, including self-directed brokerage options
- 🌴 Flexible time-off policy - take the time off that you want and need to relax and recharge
- 👶 100% paid parental leave, including 16 weeks for birth mothers, 12 weeks for primary caregivers, and 8 weeks for secondary caregivers
- 🍽️ Catered lunches and dinners for SF employees
- 🚆 Commuter benefits
- 🎉 Regular team building events, including annual offsite
Pay Transparency
Compensation packages at Column include base salary, equity, and benefits. New hire offers are made based on a candidate's experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.
The annual US base salary range for this role is $150,000-$250,000 + equity.
We look forward to hearing from you
Column is committed to working with the best and brightest people from the broadest talent pool possible. We value bringing together a team with different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences, and believe a diversity of ideas is what allows us to develop the best solutions.

About Talkiatry:
Talkiatry transforms psychiatry with accessible, human, and responsible care. We’re a national mental health practice co-founded by a patient and a triple-board-certified psychiatrist to solve the problems both groups face in accessing and providing the highest quality treatment. 
 
60% of adults in the U.S. with a diagnosable mental illness go untreated every year because care is inaccessible, while 45% of clinicians are out of network with insurers because reimbursement rates are low, and paperwork is unduly burdensome. With innovative technology and a human-centered philosophy, we provide patients with the care they need—and allow psychiatrists to focus on why they got into medicine. 
You Will:
- Contribute to the development of features and user stories for clinical applications, following established design patterns and engineering best practices.
- Write and maintain reliable, observable, and maintainable code, ensuring robust test coverage and performance monitoring.

- Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including product, design, clinical, and operations, to deliver impactful solutions.
- Take ownership of tasks throughout the software development lifecycle, including design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

- “Strong Opinions, Loosely Held” – You look at solutions in terms of their trade-offs, and you recognize when to apply common design and architectural patterns, but you’re always learning how different contexts can demand different solutions.
- Collaboration – You believe that teams can be greater than the sum of their parts when everyone is invited to the table. You know that inclusion is proactive, and you support your teammates to help them do their best work.
- Outcomes Over Outputs – You believe that the technology is a means to an end, and you keep an eye out for the simplest solution to the problem.

- Your style is like ours: high energy, positive, caring, deliberate, self-aware, curious, and open-minded, inclined to take ownership to get the best outcome but happy to transfer or share ownership with others. You’re proactive in pursuing what you want, you take pride in your ability to communicate and connect with others, and you’re always looking to improve
- You’re an analytical thinker. You love detail, but also don’t let preparation get in the way of action
- You are a great communicator, in writing and conversation, and can convey details with clarity and coherence. 
- You care about relationships, both within the team and with external partners. You want to understand others, to help others understand you, to enjoy interactions, to form career-long partnerships, and to be “best-in-class.”

Data protection needs for large enterprises are evolving into a varied usage of private/public clouds. While Rubrik has built incredibly successful solutions for both, our technical architecture needs to constantly evolve to fit our customers needs, working seamlessly across public/private clouds. To provide the same magical experience to our customers while maintaining the agility of a startup, we need to converge our solutions to a foundation that can be extended & re-used. This requires continuous rethink across many areas of product and stack.
At the heart of Rubrik’s architecture is an open-source scalable, distributed SQL database. This Is a fundamental building block for all infrastructure components (e.g. distributed file system) and applications (e.g. Oracle db backup) in Rubrik’s stack. Because of its central role, the performance, scalability, and availability demands from this component are continually increasing.
In addition, we are rethinking the APIs & interactions of this layer in order to continue building our infra for new and varied use cases for the public & private cloud. Being at the bottom of the stack, this layer (and the team) needs to provide guidance for all software layers above it (e.g., file system, reporting, UI) to transition smoothly.
About The Job
We are looking for an early career software engineer with a strong interest in distributed database technologies and cloud computing platforms and a passion to build at a high velocity
What You Will Do

Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and the world changing? Be you, with us!

"Software Engineer, AI",Sixfold,"New York, NY",2025-02-15,$7 per hour,"Who We Are
At Sixfold, we're revolutionizing the insurance industry with groundbreaking AI that handles complex analysis while empowering underwriters to focus on strategic decision-making. Our AI engine doesn't just process data – it's the first of its kind to crack the code on insurance's most challenging problems, from instant risk assessment to loss pattern recognition. We've solved the notorious ""front-door problem"" that's plagued carriers for decades, giving them the power to instantly evaluate, prioritize submissions, and capture the best opportunities.
Why We’re Excited About This Space
Insurance isn't just another industry – it's the backbone that protects everything from your local coffee shop to billion-dollar shipping fleets, and we're revolutionizing it with AI.

- Collaborate with cross-functional partners. Our teams include product managers, designers, and engineers working together to accomplish shared goals. You will collaborate with these partners, beginning with problem discovery through solution design and delivery. We work in two-week cycles and release to production at least once a week.
- Own your software through its entire lifecycle. In addition to shipping code, you will assess our most pressing product and engineering problems, identify and design solutions, write technical specs, and scope and break down projects. You will also spend approximately one week per quarter on call, serving as the first line of defense against service outages and critical bugs. If you don’t have experience with all of this yet, don’t worry - we’ll teach you!
Qualifications

"Software Engineer, Datastore",Notion,"New York, NY",2025-02-15,"$130,000 - $240,000 per year","About Us
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

As part of the Datastore Infra Team, you’ll have a unique opportunity to shape how Notion manages and scales its foundational data services, enabling innovation across the company. This role is based out of our New York City or San Francisco office.
What You'll Achieve
- You will drive the evolution of our datastore infrastructure to meet the needs of over 100 million global users and support the rapid growth of our product and business. This includes ensuring our systems are reliable, efficient, and scalable, while evaluating and integrating new technologies to keep us ahead of emerging challenges. Your work will empower our engineers to build features with confidence, backed by a strong datastore foundation.
- You will design and deliver a Datastore Platform that simplifies how teams manage and interact with data at scale. From flexible schema management to migrating hundreds of billions of records, you’ll develop tools and frameworks that make it easier for engineers to innovate while maintaining safety, efficiency, and performance.
- You will develop the skills and confidence to debug live production systems with minimal disruption, whether replacing components or managing failovers. You will participate in an on-call rotation, responding to incidents to uphold service reliability and quickly restore normal operations.
- You will partner with product engineers and other infra teams to ensure our datastore infrastructure aligns with evolving business needs and product goals
Skills You'll Need To Bring
- Familiarity with Datastore Systems: You have experience with large scale relational databases, distributed caches, and NoSQL systems. You understand how to design, scale, and optimize them to support growing business needs. Our team utilizes cloud-based datastore solutions like AWS RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache to power our infrastructure.
- Systems thinker: You understand distributed systems and can design solutions that account for tradeoffs like consistency, latency, and scalability.
- Pragmatic problem-solver: You prioritize business impact and understand the balance between craft, speed, and long-term maintainability. You’re opinionated but not ideological, and you learn new technologies as you go.
- Ownership and initiative: You thrive in a fast-moving, unstructured environment and are comfortable taking ownership of ambiguous problems. You act with a bias toward action and focus on results.
- Customer Empathy: You excel at collaborating across teams, offering guidance and solutions to unblock engineers and support them in building reliable systems. With empathy at the core of your approach, you focus on addressing the needs of those who depend on datastore infrastructure.
Nice To Haves
