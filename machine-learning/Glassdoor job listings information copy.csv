"",""Benefits package is standard overall for an office environment. It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company. These are the main differences compared to other companies:\n\nPros: They usually give an additional payment to your retirement account if NYSTEC does well that year. There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?

"",""Benefits package is standard overall for an office environment. It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company. These are the main differences compared to other companies:\n\nPros: They usually give an additional payment to your retirement account if NYSTEC does well that year. There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?

Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant.

It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company.

There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?
