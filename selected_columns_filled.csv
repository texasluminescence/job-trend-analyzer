Best of all, you are eligible for coverage on your date of hire.   Health and Welfare
Our fulltime U.S.-based employees are eligible for a variety of medical, dental, and vision plans, as well as Short- and Long-Term Disability, Life Insurance, and Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D). Coverage choices for medical coverage will vary, depending on your US location. Dental and vision plan choices are available.   Financial Security 
Your financial security is important to us, so we offer a variety of options to choose from, including 401k Savings Plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and Flexible Spending Accounts for health care and dependent care.  Time-Off Programs
PayPal recognizes that as employees pass through various life stages, their time away needs change accordingly. We provide support through the following programs: 

Sabbatical Program: 4 weeks of paid leave after completion of 5 years of service
Tracking-Free Vacation: all U.S.-based exempt employees self-manage vacation and work with supervisors to schedule time off.
Give Time: After one year of employment, eligible employees are paid 100% of base pay, or 8 hours/year, to volunteer at a qualifying community-based organization
Paid Sick Leave
Enhanced Maternity Benefit
Paid Bonding Leave within the first year of the birth or placement of a child; available to all mothers, fathers, same-sex spouses, and domestic partners
Paid Family Care Leave allows paid time off for employees to care for a seriously ill family member
Holidays: PayPal observes 10 holidays each year


Additional benefits to support your everyday living include adoption assistance, educational assistance, and employee assistance. We have the added extras too – group legal benefits, identity theft protection, and we even offer pet insurance.

Pay isn’t that of industry standards. Upper management is allowed too much leeway as far as what employees are paid, even with pay grades. "",""Benefits package is standard overall for an office environment. It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company. These are the main differences compared to other companies:\n\nPros: They usually give an additional payment to your retirement account if NYSTEC does well that year. There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?

We encourage, support, and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of Total Rewards. In addition to financial compensation, NYSTEC’s Total Rewards program believes in providing its employees the opportunity to excel and advance in their field, provide meaningful work, contribute to the community, work cooperatively and productively with colleagues, and balance work life duties.","[""Generous 403b match, 20 PTO days which increase with years of service, tuition reimbursement, professional development reimbursement, savings or student loan matching, fitness reimbursement"",""401k is good. Pay isn’t that of industry standards. Upper management is allowed too much leeway as far as what employees are paid, even with pay grades. "",""Benefits package is standard overall for an office environment. It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company. These are the main differences compared to other companies:\n\nPros: They usually give an additional payment to your retirement account if NYSTEC does well that year. There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?

It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company. These are the main differences compared to other companies:\n\nPros: They usually give an additional payment to your retirement account if NYSTEC does well that year. There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?

"",""Benefits package is standard overall for an office environment. It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company. These are the main differences compared to other companies:\n\nPros: They usually give an additional payment to your retirement account if NYSTEC does well that year. There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant. If you tell employees that you pay less than other consulting firms because the benefits are amazing, shouldn't the benefits be better than what our clients receive and also significantly better than what you can get at other firms?

It's sold to employees as being an exemplary Total Rewards Package but it's essentially the same package you can get at any company.

There's a gift each quarter and an annual gift. Mobile phone is paid for up to a specified amount.\n\nCons: You can use Cigna providers if you travel outside of the Capital District but you're locked into MVP within the Albany area. Work/life balance is not guaranteed and depends on how well the project is negotiated when the contract is signed and how much your practice leader supports their team--you will be expected to make up for this by working more with less. Merit increases are not based on an objective process.\n\nSince the majority of the projects are with state and local government clients, the benefits should compete with what you would receive as a civil servant.
