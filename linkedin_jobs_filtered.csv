Backend Software Engineer,Doxel,"San Francisco, CA",2025-02-05,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4143676751/,"Construction is the 2nd largest industry in the world (4x the size of SaaS!). But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
We have classic computer vision, deep learning ML object detection, a low-latency 3D three.js web app, a complex data pipeline powering it all in the background. We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines.
We’re at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
Role 
The role of a Backend Engineer has evolved. With the rise of local-first applications and WebAssembly (Wasm), the boundary between backend and frontend has blurred. Traditional data processing and analytics, once confined to server infrastructure, have now extended into the browser analytically with DuckDb, and visually with Three.js. This shift enables powerful, low-latency computation directly on the client, transforming how we architect and optimize systems.
Our backend team produces the foundation for Doxel's construction insights. You'll own the technology that brings insights through processing vast amounts of project data daily, by capturing and analyzing hundreds of thousands of square feet of 360 video. You will collaborate closely with Product, Frontend Engineering, and Design to build intuitive, high-performance solutions that empower our customers. Additionally, you'll partner with internal teams developing and refining our state-of-the-art LLM, Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning (ML) automation pipelines.
As Doxel scales to serve more customers, we need to fortify our data pipeline and API infrastructure to improve reliability, reduce service disruptions, and enhance extensibility for new features. You will bring backend software development expertise to establish strong design patterns, unify our data pipeline, and ensure seamless interaction across teams and systems. You are eager to learn beyond your immediate expertise and capable of mentoring others in your domain. Above all, you prioritize building reliable, low-maintenance software that supports both traditional backend processing and emerging in-browser computational paradigms.
Who You Are
You are a relentless problem-solver who takes deep ownership of your work, ensuring every line of code is correct, reliable, and built for complex, real-world domains. You anticipate failure points, eliminate edge case bugs, and engineer systems that handle ambiguity with precision. You don’t just write software—you make it rock solid. You thrive in rich domain environments where correctness matters as much as performance. You seek feedback, iterate quickly, and push yourself to improve.

TikTok is already a super app with a huge client base, and the content is completely recommended by the recommendation system according to personal preferences, but the recommendation system cannot understand video content. It can only identify the signals from users. If some creators trick our users to make some positive signals such as likes, favorites, the recommendation system believes that content is good. It will dispatch that content to more users. If the content is really bad , it will damage our users and TikTok brand perception.
Therefore, it is necessary to intervene manually from the perspective of users, creators, and platforms, so that the TikTok ecology can carry out a virtuous cycle , suppress those that do not meet the platform specifications, and advocate those that meet the platform specifications.

- Work closely with product manager, data scientist, UI designer, and other engineers to iterate on data driven product ideas.

Senior Software Engineer (Full-Stack),Lithos Carbon,"Bellevue, WA",2025-01-20,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4152293187/,"As a Senior Software Engineer at Lithos, you'll work directly with our Head of Engineering to build the operating system for one of the largest carbon dioxide removal efforts in history.
How does software play a role? Carbon removal is a mass transfer problem. We need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 — the same order of magnitude as humanity's entire global production of food, or concrete, and to do all this within the next decade.
Our bet: the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture 🚜, mining 🪨, and transportation 🚚. But just having the physical and human infrastructure is not enough.
At Lithos, we're building the operating system to plan, orchestrate, track, and optimize enhanced rock weathering. You'll combine deep full-stack technical skills with empathy and design thinking to build and scale our interconnected platform. Some examples of the diverse challenges you might work on:
- Interactive geospatial tools for mapping, analysis, and optimization
- Creative automated and human-in-the-loop workflows for digitizing PDF maps and records
- Pipelines for ingesting, converting, and analyzing raw data logs from agricultural machinery
- Audit-ready representation, tracking and reconciliation of an array of real-world activities
- Laboratory information management systems (LIMS) for tens of thousands of field samples
About Lithos
Lithos Carbon revolutionizes the carbon capture industry through enhanced rock weathering technology. We work with farmers to spread basalt rock on farmland, which increases soil health and repurposes post-industrial waste. Our technology is aimed at removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a fraction of the cost of other methods, while helping farmers improve crop yields. Our team is made up of industry-leading academic scientists and proven entrepreneurs, and we are backed by top-tier investors like Union Square Ventures and Greylock Partners. We started commercializing the technology in 2022 and already signed customers for our permanent carbon removal credits including Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, and McKinsey's Frontier program. You can read about our work in FastCompany, Axios, and on our blog.
Requirements
You might thrive in this role if:
- You have experience building apps for non-technical power users in a fast-paced, early-stage environment. We're flexible on your background, but candidates without mid-senior engineering experience are not likely to be a fit
- You are fluent in modern web development across the full stack and have experience with technologies similar to our current stack (React, Typescript, Phoenix and LiveView, and Postgres/PostGIS/SQL). We expect successful candidates will be able to rapidly pick up a new language or technology from first principles rather than look for YoE in a particular language or tool
- You have excellent communication skills and are comfortable operating in a highly ambiguous environment. You're capable of operating independently and are able to scope your work and collaborate with both internal and external stakeholders to achieve business goals without tight supervision
- You are comfortable balancing scrappy and relentlessly resourceful solutions while recognizing key areas for longer-term investment. You have an opinion for when to take on tech debt and when to pay it down
Benefits
- Competitive salary (the posted salary range for this role is $140,000 USD - $180,000 USD, depending on experience) and meaningful equity compensation
- Comprehensive health coverage including medical, dental, and vision
- Access to our 401k plan
- Unlimited PTO and sick days

Software Engineer,Brigit,"New York, NY",2025-02-12,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4148996419/,"Hi, we're Brigit! A holistic financial health company helping every American build a brighter financial future. With a business model that is aligned with our customers, we create transparent, fair, and simple financial products that put money back in the hands of our members, help them spend wisely, avoid unfair fees and build their credit quickly. If autonomy, ownership, and having meaningful input at the company you work for is important to you, come join our growing team!
Brigit is doing innovative and exciting work, but don’t just take our word for it, our work is being recognized by others:
- Built In’s 2023 & 2024 Best Startups to Work For In New York City
- Built In’s 2024 Best Startups to Work For In the U.S.
- Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies of 2022
- Forbes Fintech 50 2022
- Business Insider’s Most Promising Consumer Startups 2022
Brigit is looking for fullstack engineers to help us scale our next-generation consumer finance platform to millions of users in the next year. We’ve found tremendous traction helping low income Americans make ends meet; now is the time to scale. We’ve built a mobile/web app on 
React 
and 
React Native
 with 
Typescript
, and a backend of 
Java
 services in 
Google Cloud
. It’s served us well so far, but we need help making it even better.
Our team has two main goals:
1) 
Feature development supporting numerous external and internal applications
. The next generation of our product may look nothing like it does today - and we welcome that! The degree to which we implement new user flows, compute our proprietary algorithms, integrate with 3rd party APIs, store data, and serve traffic will make or break our success.
2) 
Scalability of our customer-facing applications.
 Growing from 100k to 10 million users presents unique technical challenges. The efficiency and reliability of both our customer-facing and internal tools needs to improve. We have fun Data Engineering tasks, automation procedures, and availability/monitoring problems to tackle. We also have many user-facing projects, including the creation and upkeep of components and libraries, REST API design, testing and QA processes, and CI/CD enhancements.
Our team is small and nimble; you'll be given an extraordinary amount of autonomy and ownership. More importantly, you have a large say in the direction of the company -- both in terms of our technology and our product.
Recent accomplishments of our team are:
- Building a Payments API platform that moves millions of dollars on a daily basis
- Implementing the advanced mathematical processes behind our proprietary risk algorithm
- Normalizing relational database schema to optimize for performance for over 1 million users
- End to end User notification (via SMS, Email, Push) capabilities
- Building internal tools that enable our Customer Support Specialists to help our customers ASAP
One of our greatest strengths is the speed at which we move. If you want to propose a new way of doing things, we are all ears. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'll be open to it. A new design paradigm? Bring it on. At Brigit you can enjoy a mature CI/CD platform with automated deployment processes, an easy-to-use local/staging/production development environment, and teammates willing to fill in the gaps. We automate manual things so we can focus on thinking and building something that helps people.
As a fullstack engineer we’re looking for someone with experience owning a feature from start to finish on both the frontend and backend. We don’t expect everyone to know everything in our stack, but having one side of overlap (frontend/backend) that you feel very comfortable with will set you up for success here.
What You Have
- 3+ years of industry experience as a software engineer
- REST based services and API development experience mainly using Java
- Experience building UI/UX for new features from end-to-end using React or React Native
- GraphQL experience a plus
- Up-to-date grasp of the constantly evolving JS language standards, ES6 and beyond (we use Typescript)
- Experience with SQL databases, constructing schemas, performing migrations and writing analytical queries
- Kubernetes, Docker or other container system experience is a plus
- Quantitative skills, knowledge or experience in Finance is a plus
What You'll Be Doing
- Evolving the APIs supporting User flows to ensure a great user experience
- Optimizing queries and relational database schema to ensure speedy response times
- Implementing algorithms related to monetary transaction evaluation, risk management, income verification, and other predictive models
- Integrating with new 3rd party APIs to serve millions of customers
- Decreasing our customer service workload by building improvements to the product or improving our internal automations
- Implementing interaction and motion design for more delightful user experiences
- Automating visual testing & visual regression detection processes
- Creating new mobile & web clients for upcoming products
- A/B testing and optimizing features that boost our business’ bottom line
The anticipated annual base salary for this position is $135,000 - $180,000. This range does not include any other compensation components or other benefits for which an individual may be eligible. The actual base salary offered depends on a variety of factors, which may include as applicable, the qualifications of the individual applicant for the position, years of relevant experience, specific and unique skills, level of education attained, certifications or other professional licenses held, and the location in which the applicant lives and/or from which they will be performing the job.
Our Benefits & Team
- Medical, dental, and vision insurance
- Flexible PTO Policy
- 401k plan
- Paid Parental Leave
- Physical and mental wellbeing benefits including Wellhub for access to virtual workouts and discounted gym memberships, and Headspace for covered virtual therapy sessions and unlimited on demand health support
- Monthly reimbursements to use against wifi and cell phone bills
- Annual reimbursement for Learning & Development
- Help hard working Americans build a brighter financial future
- High-growth company at an early stage
- A dynamic, flexible and collaborative start-up work environment with a highly talented team

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we have been a leading disruptor in the business identity market. While consumer identity technology has seen significant modernization and digitization over the past decade, business identity and verification largely continues to be a manual process, specifically in the context of onboarding businesses to receive access to financial products and services. Our best-in-class business identity platform provides access to complete, up-to-date information that financial services institutions and fintechs need to make educated decisions about their customers and facilitate rapid onboarding and transacting. Our vision is that every company can instantly gain access to all the data, products, and services they need to establish and grow their business with ease. Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal.
About Middesk Engineering
We believe ""velocity"" is the rate at which we effect realized value for our customers, not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; how will this change I'm about to make help our customers get jobs done?
When we’re coding, we're making hundreds of micro-decisions about user experience that add up. How can I communicate this exception to our customers in a manner that helps them understand what's happened and unblock themselves?
Middesk Engineering is customer-first engineering. (check out our blog post on the topic).
The role
Engineers have the freedom to create a lot of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems.
What You'll Do
- Work in React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and potentially Scala, Python, and Go to solve problems for our customers.
- Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend, backend, API, data processors, etc.
- Jam with Product Managers, Designers, Ops, and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products. 
- Share your knowledge with others in Engineering; people should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you’re early in your career, you have something to teach. 
- Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people, and good relationships matter.
- Help us interview and hire other Engineers.
What We’re Looking For
- While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic, we’d love it if you had experience with a couple of the languages in our stack (see the first point above). We’ve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster.
- You’ve worked for a high-growth, venture-backed startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or, you've founded a company and are looking to get back into it.
- You’ve been working as a professional Software Engineer for at least three or more years.
- You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value, customer acquisition cost, and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you’ve done influences these metrics.

About Moment
Moment builds modern capital markets infrastructure for the wealth management space, starting with fixed income. Founded in 2022 by former fixed income quants at leading prop shops, Moment has quickly established itself as the leading fixed income infrastructure provider for global fintechs, traditional brokerages, and RIAs.
Fixed income is the largest asset class in the world, and the market is evolving rapidly. In the past three years, electronic fixed income trading volume has nearly doubled — and in the past 14 months, retail fixed income trading volume has increased by more than 1500%. Despite this rapid growth, the wealth management space has been confined to legacy technology that doesn’t meet their needs anymore. That’s where Moment comes in — in just a matter of weeks, Moment allows customers to easily offer an end-to-end, modern fixed income solution through a simple set of APIs across data, execution, and portfolio management.
Most startups start off serving small businesses, and scale up as they convince larger enterprises to take a bet. Moment’s version of “small businesses” have been firms representing millions of retail investors — and we’re just getting started. We're growing incredibly fast and are backed by world-class investors. In May 2023, we raised a $17M Series A led by a16z with participation from amazing investors including Venrock, Neo, Contrary, and Henry Kravis.

Software Engineer (Backend),COLUMN ENGINEERING,"San Francisco, CA",2025-02-13,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4151639181/,"About Column
For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.
At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!
The opportunity
We’re a lean and experienced team. We like our current team size of nine engineers but we have a need for a talented Backend engineer to join us. We write mostly Go, but experience there isn’t that important (it’s a pretty easy language to learn). We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high-caliber and high-velocity team. We’ll require a take-home that does take time, so if that’s a non-starter for you we’re sorry. We find it the best way for you to show your skills, without being overly burdensome on the team! This role is San Francisco based and you’ll be expected to work out of our (awesome) Presidio-based office 3+ days a week.
What You’ll Need To Be Successful
- Proven experience with a strongly typed back-end language, coupled with proficiency in SQL
- A track record of making independent product decisions and exhibiting strong self-management skills.
- Preferably, an interest and desire in the financial services/fintech industry is ideal, but not a requirement, as long as you have a desire to deeply learn our products and industry.
What You’ll Get From Us
-  Comprehensive health, dental, and vision plans, including options that are 100% covered by Column for you and 50% covered for your dependents
-  FSA and HSA account options to enable use of pre-tax money for medical and dependent care expenses
-  401k plan, including self-directed brokerage options
-  Flexible time-off policy - take the time off that you want and need to relax and recharge
-  100% paid parental leave
- ️ Catered lunches and dinners for SF employees
-  Commuter benefits
-  Regular team building events, including annual offsite
Pay transparency
The annual US base salary range for this role is $130,000-$200,000.
This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Column, and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the candidate’s skill sets, experience, licensure and certifications, location, and other business and organizational needs. Posted salary ranges reflect base salary only, exclusive of equity and other compensation and benefits.
We look forward to hearing from you
Column is committed to working with the best and brightest people from the broadest talent pool possible. We value bringing together a team with different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences, and believe a diversity of ideas is what allows us to develop the best solutions.

Software Engineer (Internal Tools),COLUMN ENGINEERING,"San Francisco, CA",2025-02-13,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4151630360/,"About Column
For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.
At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!
The opportunity
You’ll be responsible for building the software that allow us to move and build faster at Column. While other companies will choose to hire an army of people, Column puts a huge emphasis on investing heavily in automation and tooling. You’ll be key person responsible for creating these tools— spending your time between both our frontend and backend engineering stacks.
You’ll write TypeScript/JS for our Retool-based internal tooling system, Typescript for our external developer dashboard, and dive into Golang on our backend. Ideally, you should have experience with Javascript, some experience with a typed back-end programming language (although experience with Golang is not required), and be very comfortable with SQL databases. 
This role is based San Francisco and you’ll be expected to work out of our (awesome) Presidio-based office 3+ days a week.
As one the only new-graduate available roles at Column, this role will be a core feeder for other engineering or customer roles on the team - product, backend, or infrastructure engineering, or product and solutions-focused customer roles.
What You’ll Need To Be Successful
A computer science degree 
Demonstrated expertise in Javascript. Some React experience is ideal but not required
Experience with a typed back-end language, coupled with proficiency in SQL
Ability to make independent product decisions and exhibit strong self-management skills.
Preferably, you should have experience or a keen interest in engaging with external customers to gather direct product feedback.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
Residence within <1h of our Presidio San Francisco-based office or the ability to relocate
What You’ll Get From Us
-  Comprehensive health, dental, and vision plans, including options that are 100% covered by Column for you and 50% covered for your dependents
-  FSA and HSA account options to enable use of pre-tax money for medical and dependent care expenses
-  401k plan, including self-directed brokerage options
-  Flexible time-off policy - take the time off that you want and need to relax and recharge
-  100% paid parental leave, including 16 weeks for birth mothers, 12 weeks for primary caregivers, and 8 weeks for secondary caregivers
- ️ Catered lunches and dinners for SF employees
-  Commuter benefits
-  Regular team building events, including annual offsite
Pay transparency
The annual US base salary range for this role is $70,000-120,000, exclusive of equity compensation and benefits.
This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Column, and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the candidate’s skill sets, experience, licensure and certifications, location, and other business and organizational needs. Posted salary ranges reflect base salary only, exclusive of equity and other compensation and benefits.
We look forward to hearing from you

Software Engineer I,TeleTracking,"Pittsburgh, PA",2025-02-05,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4144424026/,"Pittsburgh Candidate Highly Preferred
Software Engineering I, Productivity Engineering
About The Team
Productivity Engineering team members at TeleTracking are the engineer's engineers. We aim to simplify and amplify the ability for developers to build, deploy, release, and observe their changes in production. By creating software development experiences that provide abstractions around common scenarios, we pave the way for developers to focus on their core business domains.
We practice an observability-first and product-minded approach to the services that we develop and operate. To do this, we work backwards from customer value and ease of use, to planning the metrics that will help us differentiate what is working from what isn't before writing a line of code. We validate the effectiveness of our offerings by applying them in production to internally and externally facing services that we own.
About The Role
As a software engineer, you will have autonomy to architect, build and operate components of the delivery and observability platforms that are critical to TeleTracking's needs. You will collaborate with a customer base to explore how they build and deploy changes to uncover the friction that slows them down from deploying to production. With an end-to-end understanding, you will build a developer experience that leverages your findings.
An example of a developer experience that Productivity Engineering team members build is designing an interface, iterating over it until they are satisfied that it is easy to use and implementing its backend services. The backend services are instrumented with metrics that help the team gain insights on usage and improvements.
You will grow, learn, and be challenged by working across many technology stacks that go across build and deployment systems, to cloud infrastructure and microservices, and to security and observability tooling.
What will you learn?
- Building and operating resilient services that are observable with key metrics and visualize them in Grafana dashboards
- Leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, EKS, S3, EC2, RDS
- Designing and writing HTTP and RESTful APIs
- Designing reusable deployment pipelines in Spinnaker using kustomize and pipeline templates
- Applying large-scale changes across 100s of source code repositories
- Helping other engineers to build software better, faster and safely
- Researching, evaluating, implementing and operating extensions to delivery and observability platforms
What We Use Today
- Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, react, bash, AWS, Azure, Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Spinnaker, git
What We Expect
- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field involving software engineering, or equivalent practical experience
- 0-2 years of experience with an object oriented or functional programming language
Bonus Points
- Experience with observability
- Experience with full cycle development
- Building developer-facing tools
- Interest in developing services as well as the underlying infrastructure
- Experience programming in Java, Python, Go, C++
Benefits
- Medical/dental/vision plans 100% paid for employees and family members without coverage, which start from day one!

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Most Hedge Funds, Banks and Trading Firms have all kinds of legacy platforms at the heart of their operations, typically meaning only small new features can be added to their platform. Here, you’re going to get more of a “blank canvas”, and certainly much more free reign to use the right tools for right project. The ownership here will very likely be a step-up for you.
Yes, there will be challenges with working in a lean, agile team, but nothing is set in stone, and you’ll have lots of chance to make your mark across the business. You will be working across the full stack; whether it’s enhancing the OMS integration, building a brand new UI visualisation for trading results or web application APIs, your impact will be vast here.
Tech wise, we’re looking for a Polyglot Engineer that is true to the name; the stack is Python for Data, Javascript / frontend and Elixir / web, but there’s a firm belief here that a capable engineer with the right mindset can pick anything up quickly.
Ideally you’ll come from a fund / capital markets, but certainly good financial markets / domain experience. This is a multistrat fund, and so a varied asset class background would be great - the sweet spot would be someone with a few years of relevant commercial experience here.

Your work will empower our engineers to build features with confidence, backed by a strong datastore foundation.
- You will design and deliver a Datastore Platform that simplifies how teams manage and interact with data at scale. From flexible schema management to migrating hundreds of billions of records, you’ll develop tools and frameworks that make it easier for engineers to innovate while maintaining safety, efficiency, and performance.

- You will partner with product engineers and other infra teams to ensure our datastore infrastructure aligns with evolving business needs and product goals
Skills You'll Need To Bring
- Familiarity with Datastore Systems: You have experience with large scale relational databases, distributed caches, and NoSQL systems. You understand how to design, scale, and optimize them to support growing business needs. Our team utilizes cloud-based datastore solutions like AWS RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache to power our infrastructure.
- Systems thinker: You understand distributed systems and can design solutions that account for tradeoffs like consistency, latency, and scalability.
- Pragmatic problem-solver: You prioritize business impact and understand the balance between craft, speed, and long-term maintainability. You’re opinionated but not ideological, and you learn new technologies as you go.
- Ownership and initiative: You thrive in a fast-moving, unstructured environment and are comfortable taking ownership of ambiguous problems. You act with a bias toward action and focus on results.
- Customer Empathy: You excel at collaborating across teams, offering guidance and solutions to unblock engineers and support them in building reliable systems. With empathy at the core of your approach, you focus on addressing the needs of those who depend on datastore infrastructure.
Nice To Haves
- Experience with change data capture tools like Debezium for real-time data replication and migrations.
- Experience working closely with application developers, understanding their workflows, and building datastore solutions that address their challenges, such as schema changes, performance, and data access patterns.

Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.

"Software Engineer, Product",Sixfold,"New York, NY",2025-02-15,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4153424145/,"Who We Are
At Sixfold, we're revolutionizing the insurance industry with groundbreaking AI that handles complex analysis while empowering underwriters to focus on strategic decision-making. Our AI engine doesn't just process data – it's the first of its kind to crack the code on insurance's most challenging problems, from instant risk assessment to loss pattern recognition. We've solved the notorious ""front-door problem"" that's plagued carriers for decades, giving them the power to instantly evaluate, prioritize submissions, and capture the best opportunities.
Why We’re Excited About This Space
Insurance isn't just another industry – it's the backbone that protects everything from your local coffee shop to billion-dollar shipping fleets, and we're revolutionizing it with AI. Our team brings together battle-tested founders and operators who've scaled both insurtech innovations and enterprise solutions, and we're united by one mission: transforming how risk is evaluated.
That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to shape underwriting in a $7 trillion industry while doing the most important work of your career.
Who You Are

- Own your software through its entire lifecycle. In addition to shipping code, you will assess our most pressing product and engineering problems, identify and design solutions, write technical specs, and scope and break down projects. You will also spend approximately one week per quarter on call, serving as the first line of defense against service outages and critical bugs. If you don’t have experience with all of this yet, don’t worry - we’ll teach you!
Qualifications
- You have 3+ years of professional software engineering experience.
- You are familiar with web development using React and TypeScript. You understand React's component lifecycle, state management patterns, and performance optimization techniques.

Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
- Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
- Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
- Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.
Nice To Haves

- You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
